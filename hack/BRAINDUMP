## not needed for POC
* handle PVC
* block endpoint except registry ones
* redis HA deployment
* pg HA deployment

* dev mode chunks:
  * agent process checks for changes
  * if file changes detected
    * stop alread running server process
    * create new server root directory based
      on changed files.
    * start new server using the previously
      created root directory.
  * this way we have fast dev experience (hopefully)

* ptpnat
  * test following scenarios
    * program update:
      * check if ebpf programs are updated when new cni is installed
    * node restart
      * remove pod after restart
      * add pod after restart
  * ip tunnel forwarding mc server traffic
  * see https://whimsical.com/chunk-explorer-DEenwdYYJjsfRTzN2zN6vr

# TODO
* adjust routing table so packets will be sent out to the veth device by default
  * we need to make this the default route, because incoming packets from clients
    can be from potentially any ip range
  * ip netns exec 26478158-a7e1-4364-ab89-0c0cd83c8099 ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 dev 28b944013073507
