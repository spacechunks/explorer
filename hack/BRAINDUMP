## not needed for POC
* handle PVC
* block endpoint except registry ones
* redis HA deployment
* pg HA deployment

* dev mode chunks:
  * agent process checks for changes
  * if file changes detected
    * stop alread running server process
    * create new server root directory based
      on changed files.
    * start new server using the previously
      created root directory.
  * this way we have fast dev experience (hopefully)

* ptpnat
  * test following scenarios
    * node restart
      * remove pod after restart
      * add pod after restart
  * see https://whimsical.com/chunk-explorer-DEenwdYYJjsfRTzN2zN6vr

* request (TCP/UDP and HTTP) authorization
  * https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/dynamic_forward_proxy_filter#config-http-filters-dynamic-forward-proxy
    * maybe original destination is better suited: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/original_dst
  * explore redirecting sockets using ebpf
    * redirect messages to envoy socket
  * verdicts could be determined by an external source (node agent)
    * https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/listeners/network_filters/ext_authz_filter#config-network-filters-ext-authz

# TODO
  * test handler_linux.go (AdDefaultRoute)
