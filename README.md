# Explorer platform

The vision of this project is to create a space where anyone can host their Minecraft mini games easily and make them discoverable for other people. 
All of this at a very small cost due to utilizing container checkpointing, which enables us to eliminate the heavy startup cost of Minecraft servers
that makes it not possible to run them on small cloud VMs.

**Note**: This is very much still a work in progress project, so technical aspects will possibly change quite often and break things.
